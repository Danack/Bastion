Welcome to Bastion
==================

Bastion is an application that helps create and manage your own Satis repository, which removes any dependendcy on Packagist, ever, and also removes a dependency on Github being up when you are deploying an application.

Oh and it also allows you to create easily RPM packages from PHP composer'd applications.
