Welcome to Bastion
==================

Bastion is an application that allows you to create and manage your own Satis repository. This removes any dependendcy on Packagist, ever, and also removes a dependency on Github being up when you are deploying an application.

Oh and it also allows you to create easily RPM packages from PHP composer'd applications.
